The evoPROTOCOL program is a utility for making many global 
search-and-replace changes in a text file.  It is useful for changing 
a file designed for one exotic font into a file designed for another. 

This program was written in 2020 and worked well in MacOS 10.13.  
It works in Macintosh operating systems earlier than MacOS 10.13. 
I have no plans to upgrade this software for more recent versions 
of the Macintosh operating system.
